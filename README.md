This will allow you to get to common pages on your site much quicker than clicking with a mouse.

See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

## CONFIGURATION
- To use this module, simple set what user roles are allowed to access the shortcuts via the permissions page.
- Each individual user who has a role that is allowed to use the shortcuts can then switch them on/off via a checkbox on their profile.
